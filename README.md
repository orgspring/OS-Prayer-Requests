OS PRAYER REQUESTS
====================

This plugin will create a custom post type for your prayer requests, and it includes a sample form that can be used to take prayer requests on the front-end of the website. Note: Gravity Forms plugin is required to import sample form. Form includes the ability for the requester to keep his or her praye private, which means the prayer request will not show up in the prayer list on the front-end of the website.

This is a beta version plugin. Make sure to test it thoroughly on a development site before deploying it on a live site.
